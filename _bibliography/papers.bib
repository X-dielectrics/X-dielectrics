abstract = {Abstract Polymer dielectrics are ubiquitous in advanced electric energy storage systems. However, the relatively low operating temperature significantly menaces their widespread application at high temperatures, such as for hybrid vehicles and aerospace power electronics. Spider silk, a natural nanocomposite comprised of biopolymer chains and crystal protein nanosheets combined by multiple interfacial interactions, exhibits excellent mechanical properties even at elevated temperatures. Inspired by the hierarchical nanostructure of spider silk, poly(aryl ether sulfone) is anchored to the surface of wide bandgap artificial nanosheets to prepare the nanocomposites with nanoconfinement effect. The bioinspired strategy successfully improves the mechanical and electrical performances of the nanocomposite. Owing to the structural-enabled enhancements, the nanocomposites exhibit excellent breakdown strength and electrical energy storage performance at high temperatures. In detail, giant discharged energy density (2.7 J cm−3) and high charge–discharge efficiency (>90\%) are simultaneously achieved at 150 °C and 400 MV m−1. Notably, under 500 MV m−1, the discharged energy density reaches 4.2 J cm−3, which is the record high discharged energy density among polymer-based dielectrics at 150 °C. This work demonstrates a viable strategy to design high-temperature polymer dielectrics by constructing nanoconfinement in the nanocomposites.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
